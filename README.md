# Using-Data-to-Improve-a-Marketing-Promotion

For this project, using Dodgers Major League Baseball data from 2012 in dodgers.csv file, I wanted to determine what night would be the best to run a marketing promotion to increase attendance.

Using EDA to create box-plots and charts, we can find trends on the games to determine what promotions we can use to increase attendance. Also used linear regression to find what attributes could have the highest impact.
